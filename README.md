# English-Premier-League-Data
Soccer data and basic analysis from the English Premier League from 2005 to 2021

Using open-source data files from the 2005/2006 season up to the end of 2021, I have created various graphs representing different statistics.
I have also written new data used to create some of the graphs to csv files.
